I'm a Python enthusiast from the Netherlands trying to create useful tools for Autodesk Revit, Autodesk Navisworks Manage and everything IFC related.

So far I've created several tools including the 'Basic BIM Checker' for Autodesk Revit and the 'Basic BIM Checker' for Autodesk Navisworks Manage. Other than that I have a lot of ideas on how IFC can be used to its full potential. On the construction site and for maintenance purposes. This page will be dedicated to those ideas.

Please check out my [Projects page](https://c-claus.github.io/_pages/professional_projects/) for more.
