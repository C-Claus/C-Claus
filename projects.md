So far I’ve created several tools including the ‘Basic BIM Checker’ for Autodesk Revit and the ‘Basic BIM Checker’ for Autodesk Navisworks Manage. Other than that I have a lot of ideas on how IFC can be used to its full potential. On the construction site and for maintenance purposes. This page will be dedicated to those ideas.
